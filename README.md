====================

A github pages blog. The pages are statically generated by the generate.coffee script from the markdown (.md) files in the posts directory using [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) with a minor change to allow filtering of an included markdown file. The current is not really ideal because I can't pass the filename to include into jade so I have a bit of a kludge whereby I adjust the templated in memory with the name of the file I want to include.

The nice 3D menu and most of the styling is [Meny](http://lab.hakim.se/meny/) by [Hakim El Hattab](http://hakim.se/)

If you want to try it out, clone the repo, put some content in the posts folder and then just use coffee script to run the generator.
