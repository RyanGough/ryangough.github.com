<p>I&#39;ve signed up for code retreat on Dec 8th, a day long programming practice session taking place on the same day all over the world. I&#39;m heading to the <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/gdcr-manchester">Manchester</a> one. I read the other day that the task we will be working on is Conways game of life. Although i&#39;ve heard of the game of life, I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever actually had a go at coding it, so I thought i&#39;d have a quick practice run to familiarise myself a little before the event. My first attempt it pretty ugly but it kind works, you can see it <a href="game.html">Here</a>

</p>
<p>Forgive the ugliness, especially of the UI (and the UI code), I don&#39;t really know what i&#39;m doing when it comes to web browser stuff, as is probably apparent! It was just a test really, and i&#39;d refine it but its time for bed!
