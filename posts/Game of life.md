# Game of life

I've knocked up an implementation of Conway's Game Of Life in Javascript. You can see it [Here](GameOfLife/gameOfLife.html)

Full sources including some (but not enough...) tests are on [Github](https://github.com/RyanGough/GameOfLife)

Hopefully I will get chance to refine it a bit more at some point.
