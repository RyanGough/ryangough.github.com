# Game of life

I've signed up for code retreat on Dec 8th, a day long programming practice session taking place on the same day all over the world. I'm heading to the [Manchester](http://coderetreat.org/events/gdcr-manchester) one. I read the other day that the task we will be working on is Conways game of life. Although i've heard of the game of life, I don't think i've ever actually had a go at coding it, so I thought i'd have a quick practice run to familiarise myself a little before the event. My first attempt it pretty ugly but it kind works, you can see it [Here](game.html)

Forgive the ugliness, especially of the UI (and the UI code), I don't really know what i'm doing when it comes to web browser stuff, as is probably apparent! It was just a test really, and i'd refine it but its time for bed!
