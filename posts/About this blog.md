# About me

My name is Ryan Gough, i'm a Software Engineer from Manchester, England. Mostly I write C++ for work but have started to discover the joys of javascript so am having fun with that at the moment :)

# About this site

I created this static blog / site generator whilst fooling around with node.js. Currently uses the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templating engine with a little addition to enable filtering of included markdown files but its not a great solution so I'll have to have a rethink of that at some point. The sources for this are all on my github page (see above).

The funky 3D menu is [Meny](http://lab.hakim.se/meny/) by the brilliant [Hakim](https://github.com/hakimel).
