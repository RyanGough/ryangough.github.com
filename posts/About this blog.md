# About this blog

I created this static blog generator whilst fooling around with node.js. It uses Jade for the html templating with a little addition from me to make it easier to include and filter markdown files. Except its still not quite as easy as it should be, but i'm working on that...

The funky 3D menu is [Meny](http://lab.hakim.se/meny/) by the brilliant [Hakim](https://github.com/hakimel).

Lovely mint choc chip colours chosen by me :)
